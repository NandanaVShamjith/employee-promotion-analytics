# Employee Promotion Analytics & Prediction  
**End-to-End Analytics Project | Power BI | SQL | Python**

---

## Project Overview
This project analyses employee promotion data using **Power BI, SQL, and Python** to understand promotion patterns and build a **promotion likelihood prediction model**.

The project is designed as a **decision-support analytics solution**, not an automated promotion system.

---

## Objectives
- Analyse promotion trends across employees  
- Explore factors influencing promotion decisions  
- Perform structured business analysis using SQL  
- Conduct exploratory data analysis and machine learning modeling in Python  
- Present insights through an interactive dashboard  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – Dashboarding and KPI visualization  
- **SQL Server** – Business logic and analytical queries  
- **Python** – Data analysis and machine learning  
  - pandas, numpy  
  - scikit-learn  
  - XGBoost  
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## Analytical Components

### Dashboard (Power BI)
- High-level KPIs and promotion trends  
- Interactive slicers for segmentation  
- Visual exploration of promotion patterns  

### SQL Analysis
- Business-driven analytical queries  
- Promotion efficiency and policy evaluation  
- Controlled analysis across departments, performance, and experience  

### Python & Machine Learning

## Machine Learning Scope
- **Problem Type:** Binary Classification  
- **Target Variable:** `is_promoted`  
- **Model:** XGBoost  
- **Purpose:** Promotion likelihood estimation  

>  Model outputs are intended to **support human decision-making**, not automate promotion decisions.

## How to Run (Optional)
1. Clone the repository  
2. Execute SQL scripts in SQL Server  
3. Run the Python notebook for EDA and modelling  
4. Open the Power BI file for dashboard exploration

## Notes
- This project emphasizes **analysis, validation, and decision support**  
- Business insights are communicated through dashboards and SQL outputs  
- The README focuses on **structure and scope**, not final decisions
